# Orrery

**every repo in orbit**

A Linux-native command center that puts every repo in your dev directories into orbit — live git status at a glance, one-click launch into your IDE or a terminal coding agent, enriched with multi-host data and local-AI summaries.

> **`macos-compat` branch:** an experimental effort to get Orrery working fully on macOS — not fully tested yet. See [MACOS.md](MACOS.md) for purpose and status.

> **Status:** 🚧 Early development, but functional. Now a **native Rust app on GPUI** (no webview) — the earlier Tauri 2 + React build was rewritten for GPU rendering. Mission Control, multi-host enrichment, launchers, Inbox/Feed/Explore/Cleanup/Agents/Dev Tools, and local AI all work. Tagged releases produce `.deb`/`.rpm`/`.AppImage`; you can also [build from source](https://hankanman.github.io/Orrery/guide/getting-started). Expect rough edges; track progress in [the issues](../../issues).

## What is it?

Point Orrery at the directories where you keep your projects. It discovers every git repo inside them and lays them out in a dark, dense "mission control" grid. Each card fuses three sources of truth:

1. **Local git** — branch, ahead/behind, uncommitted changes, last commit, detected language
2. **Your git host** *(GitHub & GitLab, incl. self-hosted)* — stars, topics, releases, issues, visibility
3. **Local AI** — a synthesized "what is this / what's been happening" blurb, generated on-device

…and every card is a launchpad: one click to open the repo in your IDE, or to drop a terminal coding agent (Claude Code, Aider, Codex, …) straight into it.

## Features

- **Mission Control** — a virtualized grid that scales to hundreds of repos, with filters for visibility (public/private/all), dirty/ahead/starred/stale, workspace root, and language, plus an activity graph and a <kbd>⌘K</kbd> command palette.
- **One-click launchers** — open in your IDE or drop a terminal agent into any repo. Pick your tools from preset chips with real brand logos (VS Code, Cursor, Zed, the JetBrains family, …; Kitty/Alacritty/Ghostty/… × Claude Code/Aider/Codex/…). The card buttons show whatever you configured.
- **Repo drawer** — branches, recent commits, a staged-diff view with AI-generated commit messages and changelogs, and the README.
- **Inbox / Feed / Explore** — what needs you (PRs, reviews, issues, notifications), a release/social activity feed, and a browser for your starred repos with one-click clone.
- **Local AI** — repo summaries, commit messages, a daily briefing, and semantic search, all on-device via [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Turn it off and every AI affordance disappears.
- **Native desktop integration** — borrows the system theme, accent colour, and window decorations so it feels at home on KDE/GNOME.
- **Offline-first** — a local SQLite cache paints the grid instantly on launch and keeps working without a connection; visibility and host enrichment survive restarts.

See the [feature tour](https://hankanman.github.io/Orrery/guide/mission-control) for screenshots of each surface.

## Why?

There's no great *workspace dashboard* for Linux. GitKraken is heavy and git-focused; GitHub Desktop has no Linux build and is single-repo. Orrery is the at-a-glance morning view of everything you're working on — and the fastest way to jump back in.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| UI | Native Rust on [GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs) (Zed's GPU UI framework) — no webview |
| Rendering | GPU via `blade` (Vulkan), Wayland/X11 direct; [gpui-component](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component) widgets |
| Git | `git2` (libgit2, vendored) |
| Persistence | SQLite (`rusqlite`, bundled) + TOML config (XDG dirs) |
| Hosts | GitHub + GitLab REST/GraphQL via `reqwest` (rustls), incl. self-hosted |
| Local AI | [Ollama](https://ollama.com) / bundled [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) — summaries, commit messages, embeddings |
| Desktop | `zbus` (D-Bus theme/accent), `ksni` tray, global shortcut, notifications |

It's a three-crate Cargo workspace: `orrery-core` (logic), `orrery-platform`
(Linux desktop integration), `orrery` (the GPUI app + binary).

## Building

Prerequisites: a recent **Rust** toolchain and the GPUI system libraries (Vulkan
loader + headers, Wayland, `libxkbcommon`, `libxcb`, `fontconfig`, plus a C/C++
toolchain, `cmake`, and `pkg-config`). `bash scripts/setup.sh` installs them
per-distro. **Node + pnpm are optional** — only the docs site and the icon
generator use them.

```bash
cargo run -p orrery                 # run the desktop app
cargo build --workspace             # build everything
cargo test --workspace              # tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Release bundles (`.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`) are built by the release workflow
on a version tag — `cargo deb`, `cargo generate-rpm`, and `packaging/appimage.sh`
(linuxdeploy).

Full setup details — distro-specific packages and first-run configuration — are
in the [Getting started guide](https://hankanman.github.io/Orrery/guide/getting-started).

## Documentation

The docs site is built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) from the markdown
in [`docs/`](docs/) and deployed to GitHub Pages on every push that touches it:

```bash
pnpm docs:dev         # local docs dev server
pnpm docs:build       # build the static site
```

→ **https://hankanman.github.io/Orrery/**

## Rendering

The UI is rendered on the GPU through GPUI's `blade` (Vulkan) backend and talks
Wayland/X11 directly — there's no webview, so none of the old WebKitGTK
workarounds (DMABUF renderer, `GDK_BACKEND`, accelerated-compositor flags) apply.
This is the whole point of the native rewrite: the earlier Tauri/WebKitGTK build
was CPU-bound and juddery on NVIDIA, and GPU compositing removes that bottleneck.

The UI is still deliberately **flat** — it's a clean look and keeps overdraw low.
For the history of why the previous webview build was CPU-bound (and the
measurements that motivated going native), see
[docs/rendering-performance.md](docs/rendering-performance.md).

## Roadmap

The four original phases are substantially in place:

- ✅ **Local-first grid** — scan → git metadata → grid → IDE/agent launchers.
- ✅ **Multi-host sync** — GitHub + GitLab (incl. self-hosted), stars/topics/releases/issues/visibility on cards, cached locally.
- ✅ **Local AI** — on-device summaries, commit messages, daily briefing, semantic search via Ollama.
- ✅ **Starred / followed browser** — Explore (starred + clone) and Feed (releases/activity).

Next up and ongoing work lives in [the issue list](../../issues).
